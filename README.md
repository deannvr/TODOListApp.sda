# Welcome to my ToDoList Application
This ToDoList Application provides time tracking capabilities, creating projects,
creating tasks within the project and even assing them a title and a date too.
This project is part of my course program to teach myself Java.



### This Applications is allowing user to:
  <!-- UL -->
  * Create a new task
  * Assign them a title and a dueDate
  * Choose a project for the task to belong to
  * Edit the task
  * Mark the task as done
  * Remove the task
  * Sort the tasks according to date
  * Show all tasks
   * Show complete and incomplete tasks
   * Quit and save the current task list to file
   * Restart the Application with the former state restored

## This is my Application logo
